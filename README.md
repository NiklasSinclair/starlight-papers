# Starlight-Papers

Welcome to **Starlight-Papers**, a repository dedicated to the research and development of blockchain technology tailored for space applications. This project explores innovative solutions for using blockchain in environments with unique challenges, such as low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, where latency is a significant factor.

Our focus is on creating resilient, scalable, and efficient blockchain systems that can operate effectively in space, addressing the higher latency and network conditions of space communication. Here you'll find a collection of papers, insights, and technical discussions driving forward Starlight's cryptocurrency technology in the final frontier.
